**Voice** in English describes the relationship between the subject and the action of the verb. There are two primary voices:
1. **Active Voice**: The subject performs the action.
2. **Passive Voice**: The subject receives the action.

### **Understanding Active Voice**

In **active voice**, the sentence follows the typical structure where:
- The **subject** performs the action.
- The **verb** is in a straightforward form.
- Any **object** follows the verb, receiving the action.

**Example of Active Voice**:
- *The operative collected the information from Russian intelligence sources.*
  - Here, *the operative* is the **subject** performing the action on *the information*, which is the **direct object**.

### **Transforming from Active Voice to Passive Voice**

In **passive voice**, the action is emphasized rather than the subject performing it. Follow these steps to transform an active sentence into passive voice:

1. **Move the Direct Object to the Subject Position**:
   - In passive voice, the **direct object** of the active sentence becomes the **grammatical subject**.

2. **Add an Auxiliary Verb**:
   - Insert a form of **BE** (e.g., is, was, were) before the main verb. Match the **tense** of the auxiliary verb to the original main verb.
   - Caveat: Sometimes BE can be replaced by GET.

3. **Change the Main Verb to its Past Participle**:
   - Use the **-ed** or past participle form of the main verb (e.g., collected â†’ is collected).

4. **Add a "By" Phrase for the Original Subject** (optional):
   - Place the original subject in a **by-phrase** in the predicate if you wish to keep it. This is called a **long passive**. Omitting it is called a **short passive**.

**Example Transformation**:
- **Active**: *The operative collects the information.*
- **Long Passive**: *The information is collected by the operative.*
- **Short Passive**: *The information is collected.*

### **Valency and Passive Voice**

Only **transitive verbs** (verbs that require an object) can be in passive voice. To analyze valency, first convert the passive back to active form:
- **Example**:
  - *The information is collected by the operative.*
  - **Active Form**: *The operative collects the information.* This is **monotransitive** (one direct object required).

When diagramming passive voice, note both the **grammatical function** (position in the sentence) and the **logical function** (role in the action).

1. **Grammatical Subject**: *The information* serves as the grammatical subject but is logically the **direct object**.
2. **Verb Phrase**: Contains **is** (auxiliary) and **collected** (past participle).
3. **By-Phrase**: *By the operative* is an adverbial prepositional phrases showing the logical subject. *The operative* is the logical subject.

**To confirm a clause is in passive voice:**
- Check if the verb phrase includes BE/GET (auxiliary) + past participle (main verb).
- Determine if an active version exists, where the logical subject performs the action.

### **Passive Voice Patterns with Different Verbs**

1. **Monotransitive Passive**:
   - *The priceless Ming vase was dropped.* (Active: *Someone dropped the priceless Ming vase.*)

2. **Ditransitive Passive**:
   - Ditransitive verbs allow for both the direct and indirect objects to become the subject.
   - **Example with direct object as grammatical subject**:
     - *No other power had been given to the delegates.* 
     - (Active: *Someone had given no other power to the delegates.*)

   - **Example with indirect object as grammatical subject**:
     - *The subjects were handed a copy of the test.* 
     - (Active: *(someone) handed the subjects a copy of the test.*)

3. **Complex Transitive Passive**:
   - Complex transitive verbs in passive voice can have an **object complement** or **obligatory adverbial**.
   - **Example**:
     - *The third style of meditation has been called unfocused.*
     - (Active: *Someone has called the third style of meditation unfocused.*)

4. **Transitive Multi-Word Verbs in Passive**:
   - Transitive multi-word verbs can also be in passive voice.
   - **Example**:
     - *The errors should be pointed out immediately.*
     - (Active: *Someone should point out the errors immediately.*)
