## 02. Study of Grammar

### Objectives for this lesson
- Identify how grammar is defined
- Learn key influences on English usage (e.g., prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, regional and social dialects, language standards)

### Warm-up
- Read [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/academie-francaise-denounces-rise-of-english-words-in-public-life) and discuss with your peers what you think.

### In-class readings
- Read ["What is grammar and how is grammar used?"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/118016/modules/items/7001752) (5 min)
- Read ["Varieties of English"](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/118016/modules/items/7001753) (5 min)

### Definitions of grammar
- Klammer et al. (2010):
  - “the linguistic system that presumably exists in the mind of a speaker of a language”
    - Syntax + morphology
  - “the knowledge to which we refer when we say that someone "knows" a language.”
  - “a description of the language system”
  - “an ideal set of rules”
    - *He always uses good grammar.*
  - a handbook containing the prescriptive rules
    - *Look it up in your grammar.*

### Prescriptive and Descriptive Grammar
- Descriptive rules: “how our grammatical system operates, rules that are the same for all speakers of English (e.g., subjects precede verbs in most sentences).”
- Prescriptive rules “govern the version of English considered appropriate (e.g., Standard American English)”

### Evolution of grammar study
- The reason why grammar gets a bad rap
- Two hallmarks:
  - Insisted only certain “high” forms of English were worth studying
  - Studied it in an complicated, obscure way, using a system borrowed from Latin

### Prescriptive grammar
- The view that one variety (or use) of a language has an inherently higher value than others and ought to be the norm for the whole of the speech community (Crystal, 1995)  
- An approach to the study of grammar that stipulates the grammatical forms that speakers should use or ought to use. (Cummings, 2018)

### Modern/Descriptive views of grammar
- Objective
- More data-driven
- Studying language as it's actually used	by members of a	speech community in	real world contexts

### Prescriptive vs. Descriptive grammar
What camp do you consider yourself to be in at this point? Why?
  
Let's revisit this question:  
- How should language teachers handle dialect differences in the classroom?  

- Why do we use language differently?
  - Language change
  - Dialects
  - Language development

### Summary of this lesson
- Key definitions in the study of grammar, such as prescriptive/descriptive approaches, dialects, standard and nonstandard language
- Reasons for variations in grammar

### In-class quiz

Any question?

- What's next?
  - In the next part we take a look at morphology — the structure of words.

### Homework
Give the [Morphology Overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4aM8rXXeFNkqBZZEW2NbPUFgvHUrFvu/view?usp=sharing) a read. You can skip the Knowledge Check questions for now.
