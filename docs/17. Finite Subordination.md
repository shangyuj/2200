## 17. Finite Subordination
 {:toc max_level=3}
### Overview of Main Clauses vs. Subordinate Clauses
In English syntax, sentences are often composed of different types of clauses. These clauses can be **main (independent) clauses** or **subordinate (dependent) clauses**. Understanding how these clauses function and interact helps us analyze complex sentences and understand sentence structure.

### Main (Independent) Clauses

A **main clause** is a complete clause that can stand alone as a sentence. It has:
- A subject
- A finite verb phrase (with tense or modality)
- Any required constituents, such as objects or complements
- Optional elements like adverbials

**Example of a Main Clause**:
> *I had promised him the next waltz.*

- **Analysis**: This clause is independent and complete. It has a subject (*I*), a verb phrase (*had promised*), an indirect object (*him*), and a direct object (*the next waltz*).

#### Diagram for Main Clause

### Subordinate (Dependent) Clauses

A **subordinate clause** (or dependent clause) cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It relies on a main (independent) clause and fills a syntactic role within that main clause (e.g., as a subject, object, or adverbial).

A subordinate clause is **embedded** within a main clause, meaning it acts as a constituent of the main clause.

Subordinate clauses are often introduced by specific **subordinating conjunctions (subordinators)** or **relativizers** (such as *that*, *who*, *if*, *when*, etc.) that help indicate their function.

The main types of subordinate clauses are:

- **_that_-complement clauses**
- **_wh_-complement clauses**
- **_if_/_whether_ complement clauses**
- **finite adverbial clauses**
- **relative clauses**

#### Subordinate Clause Example

Let’s modify the main clause example above by replacing the direct object noun phrase with an entire clause:

> *I had promised him that the money didn’t mean anything.*

- Here, the clause *that the money didn’t mean anything* serves as the **direct object** of the main clause *I had promised him X*. This clause is embedded within the main clause and cannot stand alone.

Now we learn each of these clause types in detail.

### _That_-Complement Clauses

**_That_-complement clauses** (often called **_that_-clauses**) are **finite subordinate clauses** beginning with the word **_that_**. They are controlled by **verbs**, **adjectives**, **adverbs**, and **nouns** in a sentence. 

In this context, **control** means that a specific word (the controlling word) governs or relates directly to the _that_-clause. The _that_-clause is syntactically tied to the meaning of this controlling word and often provides additional information required to complete its meaning. 

- **Controlling Word**: The word whose meaning is ‘complemented’ by the _that_-clause.
- **Examples of Controlling Words**: Verbs like *think*, adjectives like *aware*, or nouns like *idea*.

**Example**:
> *I think **that we should just do away with it altogether.***

- In this example:
  - **Controlling Word**: The verb *think*.
  - **That-Complement Clause**: *that we should just do away with it altogether*, which acts as the **direct object** of the verb, completing its meaning.

#### Internal Structure of That-Complement Clauses

Regardless of what controls them, all that-complement clauses share the same internal structure:

1. **Subordinator (_that_)**: Introduces the clause and signals that an embedded clause will follow.
2. **Complete Clause**: Contains its own **subject**, **verb phrase**, and any necessary objects or complements.

**Simplified Example**:
> *I think **that we should just do away with it altogether.***

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5be6bb3-bcde-48fe-9158-68b2109e51be)

#### Terminology Note

- **Subordinator vs. Complementizer**: The word **that** is sometimes called a *complementizer*, as it specifically introduces complement clauses. However, we will refer to it with the broader term **subordinator** in our diagrams.

#### Omission of "That"

- In some sentences, particularly those with **verb-controlled** that-clauses, the **that** subordinator can be omitted.
- **Example**: *I think Ø we should just do away with it altogether.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d4c792-9987-437b-ae29-e34bd257c7ae)

#### Types of That-Complement Clauses Based on Controlling Words

1. **Verb-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
2. **Adjective-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
3. **Adverb-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**
4. **Noun-Controlled _That_-Complement Clauses**

#### 1. Verb-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

When a **verb** controls a that-complement clause, the that-clause fills a syntactic role required by the verb, typically as a **subject**, **direct object**, or **subject complement**.

##### That-Clause as Subject

Although rare, a that-complement clause can function as the **subject** of the sentence.

**Example**:
> *That the technique is in demand is no surprise.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d40410-fbb4-4f39-a1df-48b2048acffc)


##### That-Clause as Direct Object (Monotransitive Verb)

A that-complement clause commonly functions as the **direct object** of a verb, providing the content of what the subject thinks, remembers, etc.

**Example**:
> *Tom remembered that the sight of them had made him smile.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62872858-554f-4ce0-9db3-e4adb7978986)


##### That-Clause as Direct Object (Ditransitive Verb)

In some sentences, the that-complement clause serves as a **direct object** of a ditransitive verb, with an additional **indirect object** present.

**Example**:
> *She told her mother that she worried too much.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e18255c-a612-4541-b404-1071978b0535)

##### That-Clause as Direct Object (Passive Verb Phrase)

That-complement clauses can also act as the direct object in sentences with passive verb phrases.

**Example**:
> *I had been promised that it would be quiet and peaceful.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c340df7-f904-4daa-af8e-0cb1d12c8eb3)


##### That-Clause as Subject Complement (Copular Verb)

When a copular verb is used, a that-complement clause can function as a **subject complement**, completing the subject’s meaning.

**Example**:
> *One explanation may be that self-esteem measures are not sufficiently specific.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6480bdb8-3fe7-471a-af3d-a85f891b2529)

#### 2. Adjective-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

When controlled by an **adjective**, the that-complement clause completes the adjective’s meaning by explaining or expanding on the subject’s state or feeling.

**Example**:
> *They were happy that I had succeeded.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/980941b5-f6b5-4518-b164-3fa44fa43b22)

#### 3. Adverb-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

An adverb-controlled that-complement clause provides additional information related to the intensity or extent of an action.

**Example**:
> *Jenny startled so badly that she screamed.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2306952-8298-4d44-8031-ffcc9a69c252)

(the _that_-clause completes the meaning of "badly," providing the result from how badly she startled)

#### 4. Noun-Controlled That-Complement Clauses

With **noun-controlled** that-complement clauses, the clause specifies the content of the abstract noun, often acting as a further definition.

**Example**:
> *The idea that any noise could condemn you to death is a fundamental staple of horror movies.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf2cdc14-8853-46c1-bcd8-b96224a8d25d)

the _that_-clause completes the meaning of "idea," stating what the idea actually is:  
- the idea = any noise could condemn you to death

---

### Finite Adverbial Subordinate Clauses

Finite adverbial subordinate clauses always fill an adverbial role in the main clause. They convey a range of adverbial meanings, such as when something happened (time adverbials), where something happened (place adverbials), and how something happened (manner adverbials)—typical meanings associated with adverbials.

#### Examples of Time, Place, and Manner Adverbials:
- **Time:**  
  - *After we explained our situation, he let us in.*  
  - *When they called us to lunch, many people did not go.*
  - *These criteria are met once the prosecution negotiates pleas with defendants.*
  - *I would doze off on the sofa while the kids were awake.*

- **Place:**  
  - *Wherever she went, she saw many fine and beautiful things.*

- **Manner:**  
  - *We will go on, as though it never happened.*  
  - *They just might transform your game like they did for me.*

Finite adverbial clauses also convey other meanings such as reason, purpose, result, concession, and condition.

#### Examples of Other Adverbial Meanings:
- **Reason:** *I had misgivings about that because our equipment was far too inferior.*
- **Purpose:** *Since the program had been a success, the company applied for a full permit.*
- **Result:** *Everyone should see it soon, so that we can really exchange opinions.*

- **Concession:** Despite the main clause's truth, other facts may contradict it.
  - *Although she rarely is the protagonist, her presence is felt and appreciated in books and film.*
  - *This article concentrates on software, even though threats also arise from hardware, insiders, and physical attacks.*

- **Condition/Contingency:** The main clause is true only if specific conditions are met.
  - *If our interpretation is correct, we are led toward a completely different view.*
  - *Most students only take the test one time, unless they didn't pass it.*
  - *Stats and carries don't mean anything to me, as long as we win games.*

#### Structure of Finite Adverbial Clauses
Finite adverbial clauses begin with a **subordinator** (also known as an adverbial subordinator), which is followed by a complete finite clause with a subject, verb phrase marked for tense or modality, and any required constituents.

#### Diagram Example:
- *After we explained our situation, he let us in.*
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a43acbc0-daa8-441b-b493-04d2097fe3e1)

#### Characteristics of Adverbial Clauses
1. **Nature of the Subordinator:** Some subordinators consist of multiple words (e.g., *as though*, *even though*, *as long as*).
2. **Position of the Clause:** Finite adverbial clauses can occur in **sentence-initial** or **sentence-final** positions.

#### Multi-Word Subordinator Examples:
  - *as though it never happened*
  - *so that we can really exchange opinions*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80bfb1bc-d622-40f3-aa25-4de2ce761b14)


#### Complement vs. Finite Adverbial Clauses
Some finite adverbial clauses look similar to wh-complement clauses and finite clauses with *if/whether*. The difference lies in the syntactic role of the embedded clause:

- **Complement Clauses** (obligatory): Fill required roles (e.g., direct object).
  - *You never know **when trouble will crop up**.*  
  - *The brain monitors told them **when I woke up**.*

- **Finite Adverbial Clauses** (optional): Modify the main clause, providing context without filling a required syntactic slot.
  - *They will know the truth **when they hear it**.*
  - *She had told the tale **when she was 21**.*

#### Diagrams by Type

##### Sentence-Initial Examples:
1. **Time Adverbial**

### Finite _Wh_-Complement Clauses

**_Wh_-complement clauses** (or **_wh_-clauses**) are a type of finite complement clause that typically start with a **_wh_-word**. These clauses are sometimes called **interrogative subordinate clauses** because they can express **indirect questions**. They are structurally similar to **_wh_-questions** (like *Who are we going to see?*), but they function differently within sentences.

Like **_that_-complement clauses**, _wh_-clauses can occur as complements controlled by **verbs**, **adjectives**, and **nouns**. 

#### Example of a Verb-Controlled Wh-Complement Clause

In the sentence below, the embedded wh-clause functions as the **direct object** of the verb (bolded), and the _wh_-clause is underlined.

> *Rachel can’t remember **what they served last year**.*

- **Controlling Word**: The verb *remember*.
- **_Wh_-Complement Clause** (Direct Object): *what they served last year*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27841f83-9fe9-4f04-bb98-40b2c32ae98b)

#### Structure of _Wh_-Complement Clauses

A _wh_-complement clause is similar to _that_-complement clauses in structure. It begins with a **subordinator**, which is the **_wh_-word** (e.g., *what*, *who*, *where*). This subordinator signals the start of the embedded clause, followed by a complete clause that contains:
- A subject,
- A verb phrase marked for tense or modality,
- Any required constituents.

**Example Structure**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a910e90-ed3c-4e0c-a7e5-40e20ec0eaa8)

#### Missing Constituent: The Gap

One distinctive feature of _wh_-complement clauses is the **gap**—a missing constituent in the clause, which is represented by the _wh_-word itself. The _wh_-word **fills the gap** by moving to the front of the clause, and this gap represents a missing constituent within the clause.

**Example with Gap Identification**:
> *They served Ø last year.*
> - Here, *something* is missing in the object slot, replaced by the wh-word *what*.

This structure is rephrased as:
> *what they served last year*

In full diagrams for wh-clauses, an arrow shows the movement of the wh-word to the front of the clause, linking it back to the gap.

**Diagram with Movement Arrow** (you are not required to diagram subordinate clauses fully in the exam):  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f29f362-ab19-4424-8a18-a106e8d01258)

In abbreviated diagrams, we use an arrow to show this relationship between the _wh_-subordinator and the embedded clause, as seen below (you can diagram like this in the exam):

**Abbreviated Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e4c3e6-8e5f-42a4-8dd5-33904c523601)


#### Types of Wh-Complement Clauses Based on Control

Wh-complement clauses can occur in various syntactic positions within the main clause, depending on whether they are controlled by a **verb**, **adjective**, or **noun**.

##### 1. Verb-Controlled Wh-Complement Clauses

- Wh-Clause as Subject: A wh-clause can serve as the **subject** of the main clause.

**Example**:
> *What was in his heart doesn’t matter.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/350925e6-5895-4738-9970-46fc6bb7ad99)

- Wh-Clause as Subject Complement: A wh-clause can also act as a **subject complement** for a copular verb.
  
**Example**:
> *That would have been how Grandfather would do it.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265a6afc-7162-4f7c-8a23-70d6525e31ac)
  
- Wh-Clause as Direct Object: A wh-clause can serve as a **direct object** of a monotransitive verb.

**Example**:  
> *They had carefully recorded what they had taken.*

**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/163dc5dd-3bc0-439f-9de4-c1301c5328aa)
  
- Wh-Clause as Direct Object: Wh-clauses can serve as the **direct object** of a ditransitive verb as well.
  
**Example**:  
> *I told them when everyone had to clear out.*
  
**Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294f4b31-6720-40f7-a696-8a57f26ecbd3)
  
**Example**:
> *Everyone had been paid what they deserved.*
  
**Diagram**:   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42566ebd-593c-4d61-a751-ffeea586ea54)

##### 2. Adjective- and Noun-Controlled Wh-Complement Clauses

- Wh-Clause as Adjective Complement: A wh-complement clause can also function as an **adjective complement**, completing the meaning of an adjective.

**Example**:
> *I wasn’t sure who hung up first.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ee94a60-cb5b-4e0d-83cf-e98633ed675d)


- Wh-Clause as Noun Complement: Wh-clauses can also complete the meaning of a **noun**, often describing the content or specifics of the noun.

**Example**:
> *I have no question what his ambitions are.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c19473d9-b4b3-4446-8078-605eb1612055)

### Finite Complement Clauses with _If_/_Whether_:

Embedded finite clauses that begin with "if" and "whether" form a type of interrogative complement clause, also considered a subtype of *wh-* clauses. Unlike *wh-* clauses that correspond to open-ended questions, *if/whether* clauses are typically yes/no questions. Here’s an example where the question can be answered with "yes" or "no":
> **Example**: "I've been wondering whether I should speak up."

The structure of *if/whether* complement clauses is similar to other finite embedded clauses. Here:
- The *if* or *whether* functions as a **subordinator**, introducing a complete clause containing a subject, verb phrase, and any other necessary clause constituents.
- Notably, these subordinators do not represent missing constituents within the clause, so there’s no need to add an arrow pointing to them.

Diagram:
- In a sentence like "I've been wondering whether I should speak up," *whether* is followed by a complete clause, making it syntactically self-sufficient.

**Contexts for Use:**
*If/whether* clauses are more restricted than *wh-* clauses. They typically function as:
1. Subjects
2. Direct Objects
3. Sometimes Adjective Complements

#### Examples

##### As Subject
"Whether this practice flies next season is the real question."

Diagram Structure:

##### As Direct Object (Monotransitive Verb)
"I haven't even decided if I like this show yet."

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/226223a2-4664-4c0f-af20-2b7e39f059e2)


##### As Direct Object (Ditransitive Verb)
"The judge had asked the jury whether it would resume deliberations."

##### As Adjective Complement
"We're unclear if this is premeditated or a crime of passion."

### Finite Relative Clauses

Throughout this semester, we have seen many prepositional phrases that occur after head nouns, functioning to modify or describe the head noun:

- **Example**: *the boy on the winning soccer team*

Finite relative clauses function similarly to post-modifying prepositional phrases by providing additional information about the noun they follow. Here’s how a prepositional phrase can be rephrased into a relative clause:

- **Example**: *the boy who was on the winning soccer team*

This structural similarity is reflected in tree diagrams where both prepositional phrases and relative clauses act as post-nominal modifiers (PNMs) within a noun phrase (NP). The difference lies in their form:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d79e16-ad79-42ec-a4f0-8d98558a9d64)

#### Structure of Relative Clauses

Unlike prepositional phrases, relative clauses are finite clauses, containing a subject, a verb phrase with tense or modality marking, and any other necessary constituents. Each relative clause is introduced by a **relativizer** (a function word like *who*, *which*, or *that*). Relativizers can be **relative pronouns** (which, who, whom, whose, that) or **relative adverbs** (where, when, why).

Example diagram of a relative clause:
- **Example**: *the boy who was on the winning soccer team*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71eff298-af22-4223-a91a-7c55e8cd40bb)

  - *who* acts as the relativizer, introducing the clause.
  - The relativizer points to a gap, or missing constituent, which it helps to fill. In this example, *who* represents the missing subject of the clause: "the boy *who* Ø was on the winning soccer team."

#### Recognizing the Gap in Relative Clauses

The relative clause is often missing a constituent, known as the **gap**. This gap can be identified by examining the S node to locate any missing syntactic elements. The **relativizer** fills this gap, making the clause complete. The head noun and the relativizer are co-referential; they refer to the same entity, allowing the head noun to logically fill the missing slot in the relative clause.

#### Types of Gaps in Relative Clauses

The syntactic role of the gap can vary, and relative clauses can exhibit different types of gaps:

1. **Subject Gap**  
   - *Example*: *I have a few kids who are trying some sewing.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c1ebe4-3bc6-40fd-9354-a2e781983f3e)

2. **Subject Complement Gap**
   - *Example*: *The commercial society that we have become sometimes bothers me.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ffaba2-89e8-46f9-9154-f5811c9513cf)

3. **Direct Object Gap**
   - *Example*: *They primarily confirmed information that we had obtained elsewhere.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91508329-dc27-4d64-94e8-06295625d1a1)

4. **Indirect Object Gap**
   - *Example*: *Prosecutors talked to the woman to whom he told all his dirty little secrets.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c834bc3d-383c-4b73-bae3-bdf9e45c96a3)

5. **Object Complement Gap**
   - *Example*: *Tony could never forget the hurtful names that his so-called ‘friends’ had called him in high school.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbc2ae3-2344-454a-9bd5-d3384ae7032d)

6. **Object of a Preposition Gap**
   - *Example*: *We should reject the modern conveniences that we have become accustomed to.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a3687f-8ef5-46f4-9afd-43766144dfcc)

7. **Adverbial Gap**
   - *Example*: *The ancient prophecies had foretold a time when destruction by man had left the Earth desolate.*
   - **Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1347680d-65fa-47ef-a95b-ea8a696c18f1)

#### Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses (not in exams)

- **Restrictive Relative Clauses**: Narrow down the reference of the noun (e.g., *He went looking for the kids who stole his bike.*).
- **Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses**: Provide supplementary information without limiting reference (e.g., *One restriction is the dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits certain state tax schemes.*).

**Note**: Diagramming does not differentiate between restrictive and non-restrictive meanings as this distinction is primarily semantic.

#### Omission of the Relativizer (Zero Relativizer)

In some cases, the **relativizer** can be omitted (known as a zero relativizer), represented by the symbol Ø in diagrams. Zero relativizers are not possible with subject gaps.

- **Example**: *They primarily confirmed information Ø we had obtained elsewhere.*
![Screenshot 2024-1250](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f83b48-f658-47c3-9c37-1fec3d824aa8)


#### Placement of Prepositions with Relativizers

When the gap is associated with a preposition, the preposition can remain with the relativizer. For instance:

- **Example**: *the woman to whom he told all his dirty little secrets*
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028ac4b9-162b-4dd0-a098-8e271207f9aa)
