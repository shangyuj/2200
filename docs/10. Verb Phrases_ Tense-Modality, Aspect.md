## 10. Verb Phrases: Tense/Modality, Aspect

When diagramming verb phrases, we mark tense/modality, aspect, voice, and valency. For now we are only learning tense/modality and aspect. Major Assignment 1 and Midterm Exam will only ask you to mark tense/modality and aspect and not voice or valency since we haven't learned them. In the following examples, I provide the valency labels for some examples, but other times I will use an empty placeholder (MV: _____________) in the diagram to remind you of where the valency information will go.

### The Verb-Auxiliary-Modal hierarchy
- Verbs
   - Auxiliary verbs (subset of verbs)
      - Modal verbs (subset of auxiliary verbs)
  
- Core modal verbs:
   - _can_, _could_, _may_, _might_, _shall_, _should_, _will_, _would_, _must_  
- Semi-modal (aka phrasal modal) verbs:
   - _had better_, _have to_, _have got to_, _need to_, _ought to_, _be supposed to_, _be going to_, _used to_

What makes modals different from general auxiliaries?
- grammatical tense: modal verbs have no tense
- semantics: modal verbs express necessity or possibility

### Tense/Modality
There are three possibilities:
- present tense (pres)
- past tense (past)
- modal, no grammatical tense (modal (NT))
  
**Note: We mark tense/modality and aspect on the VP node.**

### Aspect
Perfect, progressive, and perfect progressive aspect
- Aspect marking is created through a combination of particular auxiliary verbs and participle forms of verbs:
   - HAVE + ed-participle → perfect aspect
   - BE + ing-participle → progressive aspect
   - HAVE + been + ing-participle → perfect progressive aspect
   - otherwise: simple aspect (unmarked)

### Negation in the verb phrase
#### Negation with BE as main verb
If BE is the main verb, the negator _not_ is added after BE.

#### Negation with DO as a dummy auxiliary
If there are no auxiliary verbs and the main verb is not BE, then add a dummy auxiliary DO and place the negator _not_ after the newly added auxiliary verb.
