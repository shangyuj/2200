  word: the	smallest	unit	of	language	that	can	stand	on	its	own   <br>
  morpheme: the smallest meaningful unit in a word   <br>
  syllable: a word or part of a word that contains a single vowel sound

### Morphological structure in English
We call word parts **morphemes**. Morphemes are the smallest meaningful part of language, but unlike words, they donâ€™t have to be able to stand on their own.

### Bound and Free morphemes
- Many morphemes cannot stand alone as words; they are **bound** to other morphemes.
- **Free** morphemes are able to **stand on their** own as words.
- A free morpheme is a word; a bound morpheme is not.

### Free morphemes
A free morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit in language that can stand alone.  
<pre>
health  
giraffe  
week  
side  
boomerang  
sun  
up  
</pre>

#### Compounds
In English we can combine two free morphemes to create compounds that have a new meaning together.
<pre>
weekend      week + end  
sunlight     sun + light  
playground   play + ground  
upend        up + end  
downside     down + side  
moonlight    moon + light  
</pre>

### Bound morphemes
A compound must have two free morphemes. The following are not compounds because the morphemes are not all free:  
<pre>
nonsense  
unkind   
kindness   
removes  
</pre>  

#### Practice
Think of words with morphemes that fit the following formula: (e.g. free + bound = birds; bound + free = rerun)
1. free + bound
2. bound + free
3. free + bound + bound
4. bound + free + bound
5. free + free
6. bound + free + bound + bound
7. bound + bound
8. bound + bound + bound

### Roots and affixes
- root: the base of a word, the morpheme that gives the word its primary lexical meaning
- affix: a morpheme which can come before (prefix) or after (suffix) a root
  
Example: _unhelpful_  
- _un_: affix	(prefix)
- _help_: root
- _ful_: affix	(suffix)

#### Affixes

##### Prefixes vs. Suffixes

#### Practice
- What are the roots of the following words?  
a) domestication  
b) mistrustful  
c) joyfulness

a) domestic  <br>
b) trust  <br>
c) joy  <br>
</details>

#### Identifying roots
Find the common root for the following sets of words. What does the root mean?  
<pre>
nova             auditor             endure              conceive
renovation       audience            duration            capable
innovate         inaudible           durable             susceptible
novice           auditorium          during              capture
novelist         audio               endurance           intercept
</pre>

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ‘† Click me for answer</summary>
nova: classical Latin nova, feminine singular of novus, meaning new.  <br>
audi: classical Latin audÄ«re, meaning to hear.  <br>
dure: Latin dÅ«rus, meaning hard.  <br>
capt: classical Latin capere, meaning to take.
</details>

**Tip:** We as ISU students have access to [Oxford English Dictionary](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/iastate.edu?url=https://www.oed.com), where you can find detailed etymology for words.  
  
### Affix: Derivational vs. Inflectional
Whatâ€™s the difference?  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6914a5-96d4-45e9-91c3-1ef1cab7a598)  
- Derivational morphemes **form new words**.
- Inflectional morphemes do not create new words.

#### Derivational morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b365293f-c264-44b2-9082-4fdc8ad92805)  
Derivational morphemes **form new words**. They do this by altering either the lexical meaning of a root (e.g., nonsense) or by changing the grammatical category of the word (e.g., kindness).  
##### Some derivational morphemes
1. -able
2. -age
3. -ese
4. -ward(s)
5. -esque
6. -ify
7. -less
8. -ness
9. -wise
##### The problem with derivational morphemes
Derivational morphemes are not systematic; they are arbitrary and there are no rules:

sweet: sweetness  
happy: happiness  
kind: kindness  
**but not**
sunny: sunniness  
difficult: difficultness  
warm: warmness

#### Inflectional morphemes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/613f4185-efc9-412d-ba23-d58a4145b3dc)
- Inflectional suffixes change words but do not make new words.
- All inflectional morphemes are suffixes.
- There are now only eight inflectional morphemes.

##### Practice
Identify the inflections in the bolded words.
- Example: He **wishes** he could come.
  - -es is the 3rd person singular _s_
 
The August 2020 derecho windstorm was **bigger** than most people remember. The straight-line wind
**gusts** **measured** up to 110 mph in Iowa. Trees were **broken** off by the wind. Nevertheless, **ISU's**
campus **remains** the **prettiest** campus in the world.
