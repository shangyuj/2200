### Clause Constituents
  
When we talk about **clauses**, we're referring to groups of words that form complete ideas with a predicate. Every clause contains **constituents** that perform specific functions in the sentence.
  
Here are the key components:
- **Subject**: Who or what the sentence is about (often a noun phrase).
- **Verb (Predicator)**: The action or state in the sentence (with the main verb).
- **Object**: The entity that is affected by the action (**sometimes not needed**).
  
In diagrams, we label both the **form** (what type of phrase it is) and the **function** (what role it plays in the sentence). For example:
- **NP: Subj** (Noun Phrase as Subject)

**Example Sentence**:  
*The news outlet retracted the story about the accident.*
- *the news outlet* is the **subject**.
- *retracted the story about the accident* is the predicative **long verb phrase**.
- *retracted* is the **verb phrase**.
- *the story about the accident* is the **direct object** (what got retracted).

### Verb Valency Explained
The term **valency** refers to how many extra pieces (constituents) a verb needs to form a complete sentence. Verbs can require different numbers of these pieces, depending on their type.

Some examples to show you what this means:
- e.g.: **Intransitive verbs (IT)**: These verbs don’t need anything beyond a subject and a verb phrase. Example: *I slept.*
- e.g.: **Monotransitive verbs (MT)**: These verbs need a subject, a verb phrase, and a **direct object** (DO). Example: *I ate the pizza slice.*
  
#### Full list of Verb Valency

| Valency Type     | Abbreviation | Clause Pattern                                  |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Copular          | cop          | Subj + Vcop + SC / Advloblig                    |
| Intransitive     | IT           | Subj + VIT                                      |
| Monotransitive   | MT           | Subj + VMT + DO                                 |
| Ditransitive     | DT           | Subj + VDT + IO + DO / Subj + VDT + DO + to IO  |
| Complex Transitive| CT          | Subj + VCT + DO + OC / Advloblig                |

#### **Grammatical Functions and Valency Patterns**

Let’s break down the different parts of a sentence and how verbs interact with them:

| Function                 | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Subject                  | Subj         | The entity the sentence is about, typically placed before the verb. |
| Subject complement       | SC           | Describes the subject, often an adjective or noun phrase. |
| Direct object            | DO           | The entity affected by the verb. |
| Indirect object          | IO           | The entity receiving the direct object. |
| Object complement        | OC           | Provides information about the direct object. |
| Optional adverbial       | Advl         | Additional information on time, place, manner, etc., not required to form a complete clause. |
| Obligatory adverbial     | Advloblig    | Necessary adverbial information required to complete the clause. |

### Copular (cop)

**Copular verbs** (also called **linking verbs**) are a special type of verb. Instead of showing an action, they connect the subject to something that gives more information about it. These verbs usually need one of two things to complete the sentence:
1. A **subject complement (SC)**: This describes the subject.
2. An **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)**: This tells something like where or when the subject is.

#### **Pattern 1: Subj + Vcop + SC**
The **subject complement (SC)** describes the subject, often adding more information or identifying it.

- **Example**: 
  - *Frank is a cardiologist.*
  - *The music sounds fantastic.*

  **Tree Diagram**:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f12171-ec47-412c-9727-1855f096ee27)

#### **Pattern 2: Subj + Vcop + Advloblig**
The **obligatory adverbial** is needed to complete the sentence, often describing **where** or **when** something is happening.

- **Example**: 
  - *Paul was in power at that moment.*

  **Tree Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cce81da5-8e4c-4391-ac07-9422e9c7a902)

#### **Test for copular verbs**
To see if a verb is copular, try replacing the verb with an equals sign. If the sentence still makes sense, it’s a copular verb:
- *Frank = a cardiologist.*
- *The music = fantastic.*

#### More diagram examples

1. *The final exam proved difficult.*  
   - *Difficult* is describing the subject.

2. *Annie and Janine look surprised.*  
   - *Surprised* is describing Annie and Janine.

3. *Her sincerest wish is that Bill makes a speedy and full recovery.*  
   - The subject complement here is a whole clause.

#### Introduction to long verb phrase (LVP)
The LVP consists of the verb phrase plus all other constituents that are required by the main verb.

#### Copula Valency Practice
Diagram these:
- That painting looks amazing.
- I was a different person yesterday.
- She is downstairs.
- Dad is in the kitchen now.

#### **Optional vs. Obligatory Adverbials**

This distinction is important because adverbials can either be optional or necessary for the sentence to be complete:

- **Optional Adverbials**: These are extra details about the action. If we remove them, the sentence still makes sense.
  - Example: *The news outlet retracted the story by the next day.*
    - *by the next day* is optional—it tells **when** the action happened but is not essential.
  
  **Tree Diagram**:

- **Obligatory Adverbials (Advloblig)**: These are necessary for the sentence to make sense. Without them, the sentence would be incomplete.
  - Example: *Paul was in power at that moment.*
    - *in power* is essential here. Without it, *Paul was* sounds incomplete.

### Intransitive (IT)
**intransitive → not transitive → no objects**  
- **Intransitive verbs** are verbs that do not require any object to complete their meaning. They need only a subject and a verb to form a grammatically correct clause. In other words, the action of the verb doesn’t transfer to any object.
  
#### Example:  
- *Tim smiled throughout the concert.*
  - Here, the verb *smiled* does not act on any object. The **prepositional phrase** *throughout the concert* provides additional information about when the action happened, but it’s not required to complete the sentence.
  - The sentence still makes sense without the optional adverbial: *Tim smiled.*

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb9697f-0a7c-4e20-8912-3a57d7556faa)  
  
#### Another example:  
- *They arrived next week.*  
  - Here, *next week* is an **optional adverbial** indicating time. It’s not essential to the sentence’s meaning, but it provides extra information about when the action happened. The sentence has no object.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47782779-6988-423d-bbf8-810c136e015d)  

#### Summary of intransitive verbs
- Do not require any object.
- May be accompanied by **optional adverbials** that provide extra information about time, place, or manner, but the sentence can stand alone without them.

---

### Monotransitive (MT)
**monotransitive → ONE transitive → ONE object**  
- **Monotransitive verbs** are verbs that require one additional element after the verb, specifically a **direct object (DO)**. The **direct object** is the entity affected by the verb’s action.

#### Example:  
- *The man hit the table with full force.*  
  - The verb *hit* needs a **direct object** to complete the sentence. Without it (*The man hit Ø*), the sentence becomes incomplete.
  - *The table* is the **direct object** because it’s the thing being acted upon (the thing that was hit).
  - *With full force* is an **optional adverbial** describing how the action happened, but it’s not necessary to complete the sentence.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bfa5e1b-869a-4789-bc2b-896e0e132da0)

- In this sentence, the **direct object** (DO) is essential for the sentence to be complete, but the **prepositional phrase** (PP:Advl) *with full force* is optional, providing extra detail about the manner of the action.

#### Another example:  
- *The dressmaker cut the expensive fabric.*  
  - The verb *cut* requires a **direct object** (*the expensive fabric*). The sentence would be incomplete without it: *The dressmaker cut Ø*.

**Diagram**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772abcfc-6cdd-437c-9aff-bafba00b44b8)

**You can also put a clause in the direct object slot:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/215db453-7234-4329-af63-b94458166ad4)

#### Summary of monotransitive verbs
- The verb must be followed by a **direct object**.
- **Optional adverbials** may also be present but aren’t required for grammatical completeness.

---

### Ditransitive (DT)
**ditransitive → TWO transitive → TWO objects**  
- **Ditransitive verbs** are more complex because they require two objects: a **direct object (DO)** and an **indirect object (IO)**. The **indirect object** is typically the recipient of the **direct object**.

There are two common patterns for ditransitive verbs:

#### Pattern 1: Subj + VDT + IO + DO 
   In this pattern, the **indirect object** comes before the **direct object**.
 
   **Example Sentence**:  
   - *John gave me the money.*  
     - *Me* is the **indirect object** (the person receiving the money).
     - *The money* is the **direct object** (the thing being given).

   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6cacaee-7edb-425f-b00e-debb0b35abae)

   **Another example**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3506a2b2-06d2-43f5-b132-c379970369cd)

#### Pattern 2: Subj + VDT + DO + to/for IO
   In this pattern, the **direct object** comes first, followed by a **prepositional phrase** with *to* or *for* indicating the **indirect object**.

   **Example Sentence**:  
   - *The teacher sent the homework to the absent student.*  
     - *The homework* is the **direct object** (the thing being sent).
     - *To the absent student* is the **indirect object** (the recipient of the homework).

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f3094c1-9c40-409d-bd15-123f362add66)

   **More examples**

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764b48c5-285b-4659-b048-8d57816977f6)

   **Again, sometimes we can put a clause in the object slots, for example:**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a141806-cdfb-4896-b09a-cb2c73c88564)

#### Ditransitive verb with ellipted direct object
Occasionally, the direct object of a ditransitive verb is ellipted, or not explicitly stated. However, logically, we know that something has to be serving as the direct object.
- For example: _Her mother had promised her._ 
    - _her_ ≠ direct object (_her_ is not what she promised)
    - _her_ = indirect object (_her_ is who received the promise)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18b24eda-65e4-48c5-a94f-243c66c6f866)

#### Summary of ditransitive verbs
- **Pattern 1**: The **indirect object** comes before the **direct object**.
- **Pattern 2**: The **direct object** comes before the **indirect object**, which is indicated by a **prepositional phrase** (with *to* or *for*).

---

### Complex Transitive (CT)

**Complex transitive verbs** are verbs that require two additional elements after the verb to complete their meaning. These verbs are unique because, unlike ditransitive verbs, they require a **direct object (DO)** followed by an **object complement (OC)** or an **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)**. 

Here’s a breakdown of the key features:

1. **Direct Object (DO)**: The first element following the verb, which is the entity affected by the action.
2. **Object Complement (OC)** or **Obligatory Adverbial (Advloblig)**: 
   - The **object complement (OC)** provides extra information about the direct object, describing or renaming it.
   - The **obligatory adverbial (Advloblig)** provides essential circumstantial information such as location or state, completing the meaning of the verb.

#### Pattern 1: Subj + VCT + DO + OC
   - The object complement (OC) adds more detail or description to the direct object (DO). It can be an adjective phrase, noun phrase, or clause that provides additional information about the direct object.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *Still, he considered himself lucky.*
     - *Himself* is the **direct object** (the person affected by the verb).
     - *Lucky* is the **object complement**, describing the state of the direct object.
   
   **Diagram**:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76d285ef-2d8e-41cb-9592-2750ccdb05ed)

   **Another Example**:
   - *They found the boy friendly.*
     - *The boy* is the **direct object**.
     - *Friendly* is the **object complement** describing *the boy*.

   **Diagram**:  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ad9728-a67e-48bd-b87c-053eda014855)

  
   The above examples use adjective phrases as object complements. Sometimes, object complements can also be noun phrases:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a75bcb-7099-4805-83a1-db492fa7a30d)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24914254-6aa8-4bb2-9ec9-a3f0b6c81cab)


#### Pattern 2: Subj + VCT + DO + Advloblig
   - In this pattern, the verb requires an **obligatory adverbial** instead of an object complement. This adverbial often indicates the location or state of the direct object.

   **Example Sentence**:
   - *The verdict left their hope in pieces.*
     - *Their hope* is the **direct object** (the thing affected by the verb).
     - *In pieces* is the **obligatory adverbial** indicating the resulting state of the direct object.

   **Diagram**:  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5631f4de-7403-41a6-85a9-97e6e4d18d5a)

   **Another Example**:
   - *Americans’ debts are driving the economy into a danger zone.*
     - *The economy* is the **direct object**.
     - *Into a danger zone* is the **obligatory adverbial** providing necessary detail about the state or location of the direct object.
