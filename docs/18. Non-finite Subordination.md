## 18. Non-finite Subordination
{:toc max_level=3}
### What is non-finite subordination?
So far, the subordinate clauses we have diagrammed have been finite. Finite subordinate clauses usually contain:
1. An explicit subject.
2. A verb phrase marked for tense or modality.

Finite subordinate clauses are often introduced by subordinators. Examples:

- **Finite adverbial clause:**  
  ***Because** we looked so much alike, I was her celebrity double.*

- **That-complement clause:**  
  *I reminded myself **that** there is a first time for everything.*

- **Wh-complement clause:**  
  *I knew **what** the appearance of indifference might mean.*

Now, we move on to **non-finite subordinate clauses**, another type of dependent clause that cannot stand alone. Non-finite clauses differ from finite clauses in two key ways:
1. They generally lack an explicit subject.
2. Their verb phrases are not marked for tense or modality.

### Examples of Non-finite Subordinate Clauses

Non-finite subordinate clauses are bold in the examples below. Note that these clauses cannot stand alone as independent clauses:

- *I told everyone **to secure their life jackets properly.***  
  (*to-infinitive clause*)

- *She helped her mother **dust the precious books.***  
  (*bare infinitive clause*)

- ***Facing the possibility of years in prison**, she agreed to a plea deal.*  
  (*ing-participle clause*)

- ***Taken by surprise**, he simply made the wrong choice.*  
  (*ed-participle clause*)
  
From the above examples, we can see:
- Non-finite clauses begin directly with a verb (e.g., *to secure*, *dust*, *facing*, *taken*), followed by other elements in the predicate.
- They lack grammatical tense or modality.
- The subject is usually not explicitly present but can often be inferred logically.

### Diagramming Non-Finite Subordinate Clauses

Non-finite clauses share the following basic structure:

- **Verb Phrase (VP):** Includes the main verb and any required or optional elements.  
  Example:  
  - *To secure their life jackets properly*
    - Main verb: *secure*
    - Required: *their life jackets* (direct object)  
    - Optional: *properly* (adverbial)

When diagramming, non-finite subordinate clauses are labeled as **nf sub cls** (non-finite subordinate clause).

#### Syntactic Positions

Non-finite subordinate clauses can serve as constituents in a main clause. They can occur in various syntactic positions, including:

- Direct Object (DO)
- Object Complement (OC)
- Adverbial (Advl)

They may also appear as:

- Subjects
- Subject Complements
- Adjective Complements
- Noun Modifiers
- Noun Complements
- Objects of Prepositions

### _To_-Infinitive Clauses

To-infinitive clauses, or **to-clauses**, are the most common type of non-finite clause and are highly flexible in terms of their syntactic positions. They are easily recognized by their introduction with the infinitive marker **_to_**, which acts as a subordinator.

#### Passive Voice in _To_-Clauses

Though to-clauses are not marked for tense or modality, the verb in a to-clause can occur in passive voice. Example:  
- *Perhaps this shift in the economy was to be expected as the baby boomers aged.*

#### Syntactic Positions of _To_-Clauses

##### **As Verb Complements**

To-clauses often fulfill a syntactic slot required by a verb, serving as a complement. They can act as:

- **Subject:**  
  *To restore the village became his primary goal.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce8f298-e827-4e65-914b-fd9c9875f599)


- **Direct Object (DO) of Monotransitive Verbs:**  
  *We might need to know the law of a previous era.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72167849-6673-4eae-9bfb-ec27b162cf4a)


- **Direct Object (DO) of Ditransitive Verbs:**  
  *I told the kids to meet me at lunchtime.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48b30c50-2dfd-4508-b122-2795815a5bdd)


- **Subject Complement:**  
  *Almost overnight, the challenge became to make ends meet.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b05960-9296-469d-a665-d67209259e6f)


- **Object Complement:**  
  *They believed the tradition to be relatively new.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceaee6dc-b5a7-4d52-881a-dd1c4836aeee)

##### **As Adjective Complements**

To-clauses can complement adjectives, providing additional information.

- Example:  
  *I’m so sorry to wake you up so early.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5d661f8-416a-44c8-ab9d-1825b88085e3)

##### **As Post-Nominal Modifiers**

To-clauses can modify nouns by adding descriptive information, functioning as post-modifiers.

- Example:  
  *She had never seen such beautiful things to buy.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f825c6e6-8a90-4933-b581-d9339b0d4b1b)

##### **As Adverbials**

To-clauses as adverbials typically convey reason or purpose, answering "why?" for the main clause.

- Example:
  *To battle my stress, I run every day of the week.*

### Bare Infinitive Clauses

Bare infinitive clauses are a special type of **to-infinitive clause**. They are structurally similar to to-clauses but do **not** begin with the infinitive marker **to**. Instead, these clauses begin with the **base form of the verb**, which is the same form that typically follows the infinitive marker **to**.

#### Examples of Bare Infinitive Clauses

1. *He helped him find a job as a car mechanic.*  
2. *A community effort helped build this company.*

#### Identifying Bare Infinitive Clauses

1. **Re-insertion of "to":**  
   In many cases, you can reinsert the infinitive marker **to** into a bare infinitive clause:  
   - *He helped him **to** find a job as a car mechanic.*  
   - *A community effort helped **to** build this company.*

2. **Exceptions:**  
   Some bare infinitive clauses do not allow reinsertion of **to**:  
   - *HMOs are letting the public know the benefits of their organizations.*  
     - Incorrect: *HMOs are letting the public **to** know the benefits of their organizations.*

#### Verbs Associated with Bare Infinitive Clauses

Bare infinitive clauses occur with a restricted set of verbs. Examples include:

- **Help** + bare infinitive:  
  - *He helped find the solution.*

- **Dare** + bare infinitive:  
  - *She dared speak the truth.*

- **Feel/See/Make** + NP + bare infinitive:  
  - *They felt the wind blow.*
  - *I saw him leave the house.*
  - *She made the team work harder.*

#### Diagramming Bare Infinitive Clauses

In this class, bare infinitive clauses are **not diagrammed**, but you are expected to recognize them when they appear.

### _Ing_-Participle Clauses

_Ing_-participle clauses, or **_ing_-clauses**, are a type of non-finite clause that begins with an **_ing_-participle form** of a verb. These clauses are straightforward to identify because of their characteristic **-_ing_** verb form.

#### Characteristics of _Ing_-Clauses

1. **Non-finite Nature:**
   - The verb phrase (VP) is **not marked for tense or modality**.
   - The **-ing** participle appears alone without the auxiliary verb *be*.  
     - Example (finite progressive clause): *She is reading a book.*  
     - Example (non-finite _ing_-clause): *Reading a book is relaxing.*

2. **Syntactic Positions:**
   - _Ing_-clauses can occur in a range of syntactic positions, though their usage is more restricted compared to to-clauses.

#### Syntactic Positions of _Ing_-Clauses

##### 1. **As Verb Complements**

- **Subject:**  
  *Having a reliable clinical test can make diagnoses safe, fast, and accurate.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d01ff5a7-97bd-4685-9eb9-33ac04833586)

- **Subject Complement (SC):**  
  *My favorite pastime is curling up by a roaring fire.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd44dd4-5bbc-4974-af92-9154c1212972)

- **Direct Object (DO):**  
  *Witnesses don’t remember hearing any screeching before impact.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a256c5-a946-4341-8f46-fa8f3085d9d5)

- **Object Complement (OC):**  
  *I found myself thinking about all the possibilities.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ad49659-ac94-4243-9a84-c622baa54522)

##### 2. **As Objects of a Preposition**

- Example:  
  *We are interested in seeing the depth of this information.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c7e101-5857-4f94-9d9f-eacaa08f7529)

##### 3. **As Post-Nominal Modifiers**

_Ing_-clauses can modify nouns, functioning as post-nominal modifiers by adding descriptive information about the head noun.

- Example:  
  *They have outreach materials for people working with different constituencies.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dde4ca92-0d5a-4b5a-879b-f05f8b6f121a)

##### 4. **As Adverbials**

_Ing_-clauses as adverbials typically convey descriptive information about how, when, where, or why events in the main clause occurred.

- Example:  
  *Holding the frame in his left hand, he wiped the dust from the glass.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2808717-bc9f-472d-bcec-5bed68d1dc0a)

### _Ed_-Participle Clauses

_Ed_-participle clauses, or **_ed_-clauses**, are a type of non-finite clause that begins with an **_ed_-participle form** of a verb. These clauses are relatively less common and occur in more restricted syntactic positions compared to other non-finite clauses.

#### Characteristics of _Ed_-Clauses

1. **Non-finite Nature:**
   - The verb phrase lacks auxiliary verbs like *have* (used for perfect aspect) or *be* (used for passive voice).
   - The **_ed_-participle** appears alone.

2. **Logical Passive Voice:**
   - _Ed_-clauses are inherently passive. If restated as finite clauses with an explicit subject, they would always take the passive voice.  
     - Example:  
       - _Ed_-clause: *Frustrated by the lack of action, activists have taken their causes to the courts.*  
       - Finite clause: *Activists were frustrated by the lack of action.*

#### Syntactic Positions of _Ed_-Clauses

##### 1. **As Adverbials**

_Ed_-clauses as adverbials provide descriptive information about the circumstances of the main clause, answering questions like **how**, **when**, **where**, or **why**.

- Example 1:  
  *Frustrated by the lack of action, activists have taken their causes to the courts.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3b45b8a-fef2-43c1-9379-1f0cffaf9e4f)

- Example 2:  
  *Accompanied by a roar of approval, they delivered a passionate bilingual version.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/121c4aa6-edfb-4e1b-8460-31349553b601)

##### 2. **As Post-Nominal Modifiers**

_Ed_-clauses can also modify nouns as post-nominal modifiers. Similar to ing-clauses in this role, ed-clauses provide descriptive information about the noun they follow.

- Example 1:  
  *The damage caused by the intelligence leak is far-reaching and irrefutable.*  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4090af-93f8-440d-ac6e-f4a811282c70)

- Example 2:  
  *We have always been supportive of legal actions taken by the ACLU.*
