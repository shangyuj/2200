## 14. Multi-Word Verbs (MWV)

**Multi-word verbs** consist of a main verb combined with one or more particles (like prepositions or adverbs) that, together, create a new, often idiomatic, meaning. In these verbs, the combination of words changes the literal meaning, making it necessary to interpret them as a unit.

### **Recognizing Multi-Word Verbs**
To identify a multi-word verb, consider whether the verb and particle together create a unique meaning that doesn’t match the individual meanings of each word. For instance:
- *He ended up homeless.* Here, *ended up* means *became*, which differs from *end* and *up* used separately.

**Examples of Multi-Word Verbs with Single-Word Paraphrases**:
1. *He **ended up** homeless.* (became)
2. *The business **took off** after that.* (succeeded or grew)
3. *The semi-truck had **shut down** the interstate.* (closed)
4. *The court **looked at** traditional forms of communication.* (considered)

When diagramming, treat these verb and particle/preposition combinations as single units under the **MV** node. 

### **Diagramming Multi-Word Verbs and Identifying Valency**

Multi-word verbs can have different **valencies** based on the sentence’s structure. Let’s look at how to determine the valency by examining the number and function of constituents after the verb.

1. **Multi-Word Verb with Copular Valency**:
   - When the multi-word verb functions like a **copular verb**, it links the subject to additional descriptive information.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *He ended up homeless.*
     - Here, *ended up* acts as a **copular verb** connecting *He* (subject) with *homeless* (subject complement), describing his state.

2. **Multi-Word Verb with Intransitive Valency**:
   - When there’s no required element after the multi-word verb, it has an **intransitive** valency.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *After that, the business really took off.*
     - Here, *took off* stands alone with no required direct or indirect object, making it an **intransitive verb**.

3. **Multi-Word Verb with Monotransitive Valency**:
   - When the multi-word verb requires a **direct object** to complete the meaning, it has a **monotransitive** valency.
   
   **Example Sentence**:
   - *The semi-truck rollover had shut down the interstate.*
     - Here, *shut down* acts on *the interstate* (direct object), making the verb monotransitive.

4. **Monotransitive Multi-Word Verbs with Particle Movement**:
   - For some monotransitive multi-word verbs, the particle can move after the direct object. In these cases, both forms are correct:
     - *The semi-truck rollover had shut down the interstate.*
     - *The semi-truck rollover had shut the interstate down.*

     - Use **…** in the diagram to show the particle’s movement after the direct object. Place an arrow to indicate the particle’s surface position in the sentence.
