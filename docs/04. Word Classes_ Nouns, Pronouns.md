### A Game (Family Feud-ish)
This game is based on the [GUM Corpus (Georgetown University Multilayer Corpus)](https://gucorpling.org/gum/).  
  
**Question: What are the top 10 most commonly used words in English?**  

Answer:  
<pre>
Rank    Word              Percentage    
1       the               5.24%    
2       BE (of any form)  2.90%    
3       of                2.53%     
4       and               2.50%

10      it                0.65%    
</pre>
  
What word class is each of these top 10 words?
  
What do you think is the most frequently used word class in English?  


### Objectives for this lesson
- Understand what word class is
- Use morphological and syntactic features to identify the word classes of nouns and pronouns
- Understand the distinction between common and proper nouns, count and non-count nouns, abstract and concrete nouns
- Distinguish sub-classes of pronouns

### Identifying word class
Word class = Part of Speech (POS)
- Traditional means of teaching word class: using semantic features
  - Noun = person, place, or thing
  - Verb = action word
- We will use morphological and syntactic features to identify word classes
  - The builder’s _plan_ was to lay the foundations in a fortnight.
  - They _plan_ to visit Paris next spring.
 
### “Major” and ”Minor” word classes
- Major class words: Content words
  - Noun (_castle_)
  - Verb (_decide_)
  - Adjective (_happy_)
  - Adverb (_beautifully_)

- Minor class words: Function words
  - Pronoun (_their_)
  - Determiner (_the_)
  - Auxiliary (_will_)
  - Preposition (_across_)
  - Conjunction (_and_)
  - Particle (break _up_)

### Nouns: What do we already know?
- A person, place, thing, idea, event, etc.

**But we can	also	identify	content	words	by	 their	forms	(morphology)	and	where	 they	are	in	the	phrase	or	sentence	 structure	(syntax).**
  
### ID tests of “noun-ness”
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60fcd955-bcd4-481b-a0dd-9b348711ca5c)

Basically...  
- A noun is a word that can be made plural and/or possessive; it is signaled by determiners

### Common/Proper nouns
- Common nouns are general names.
- Proper nouns are specific people, places, or things.
- Proper nouns are capitalized.
  - The **singer** was excited to take the stage.
  - **Taylor Swift** released her new album today.

### Concrete/Abstract nouns
- Concrete: tangible (people, objects, events)
- Abstract: intangible (ideas, values, emotions)

### Collective and non-count nouns
- Collective nouns
  - Can be followed by singular or plural verb form depending on meaning
    - The **team** is here on vacation.
    - The **team** have chosen different restaurants.
- Non-count nouns
  - Do not take a/an
    - The car needed **oil**.
  - Some can be both
    - Example: water, experience

### Pronouns
Pronouns help us avoid repetition!
- Michael bought the cheesecake for Michael, and Michael ate it all.
- Michael bought the cheesecake for himself, and he ate it all.

### What are pronouns
- They stand in for
  - Nouns
  - Noun phrases
  - Nominals
- A pronoun’s **antecedent** is the name for what the pronoun stands in for.

### Pronoun subclasses
#### Personal pronouns
  - Subject and Object forms
  
#### Possessive pronouns
  - Take the place of a noun and show possession.
    - I want *yours*.
    - They left *theirs* at home.

"My car is expensive." Is "my" a possessive pronoun?  
  
#### Demonstrative Pronouns
- Convey information about the position of something.
  - _this_/_that_/_these_/_those_
    - The girl wants **this**.
    - **That** is unbelievable.
  
"That car is expensive." Is "that" a demonstrative pronoun?

#### Reflexive Pronouns
Formed by added _–self_ or _–selves_ to the personal pronouns
- Must have their antecedent in the same clause.

#### Emphatic Reflexive Pronouns
- Also known as intensive pronoun.
- Serve as appositive to emphasize a noun, but movable
  - I *myself* checked the locks before leaving the house.
  - The oncologist *himself* confirmed the patient’s diagnosis.

#### Reciprocal pronouns
**Each other** and **one another**
- Used as objects to refer to previously named nouns
  - The children borrow from each other.
  - Juan and Claudia help each other. 
  - The sisters never wrote to one another.

#### Indefinite pronouns
There are a lot of them!
- Express quantities, definiteness
- Often unidentifiable antecedent

#### Interrogative Pronouns
- Used to ask questions
   Includes some Wh- words (_who_/_whose_/_whom_/_which_)

#### Relative Pronouns
_who_, _whom_, _whose_, _which_, _that_
- Occur in relative clauses (clauses that modify their antecedents)
