## 11. Adjective and Adverb complement, Object of a Preposition, Post-nominal Modifier

Adjective complement, adverb complement, object of a preposition, and post-nominal modifier were briefly mentioned before but not explained in detail. However, you do need to understand these concepts to be able to complete Major Assignment 1 and Midterm Exam.
  
### **Complements**
A complement is a word or group of words necessary to complete the meaning of a sentence. Without a complement, the sentence is incomplete or lacks the necessary information.
  - Complements differ from modifiers, which are optional and add extra information.

#### **Adjective complement (AdjCompl)**
- An adjective complement is a clause or phrase that follows an adjective and provides information to complete its meaning.
- **Examples**:
  - “She is afraid **to speak in public**.” (_To speak in public_ is an adjective complement that completes the meaning of _afraid_.)
  - “They are eager **for the meeting to start**.” (_For the meeting to start_ complements the adjective _eager_.)
  
- **Types of Adjective Complements**:
  - **Infinitive Phrases**:
    - E.g., "He is happy **to help**."
  - **Prepositional Phrases**:
    - E.g., "We were delighted **with the results**."
  - **That-clauses**:
    - E.g., "I am certain **that she will arrive on time**."

#### **Adverb complement (AdvCompl)**
- Similar to how adjective complements work, an adverb complement is a clause or phrase that follows an adverb and provides information to complete its meaning.
- For example:
   - Unfortunately **for us**, there was no First Class. (_For us_ is an adverb complement that completes the meaning of _unfortunately_.)

### **Object of a Preposition (ObjP)**
- The object of a preposition (ObjP) is the noun phrase that follows a preposition and completes the prepositional phrase.
  
- **Examples**:
  - “She placed the book **on the table**.” (_the table_ is the object of the preposition _on_.)
  - “We talked **about the project**.” (_the project_ is the object of the preposition _about_.)

### **Post-Nominal Modifier (PNM)**
- A post-nominal modifier (PNM) is a phrase that comes **after** a noun to provide more information about it. PNMs often include prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and appositive noun phrases.
  
- **Examples (Types of PNMs)**:
  - **Prepositional Phrase**: “The book **on the table** is mine.” (_On the table_ is a PNM that modifies _book_.)
  - **Relative Clause**: “The student **who studied hard** passed the exam.” (_Who studied hard_ is a PNM modifying _student_.)
  - **Appositive Noun Phrase**: “My brother, **a talented musician**, is performing tonight.” (_A talented musician_ is a PNM that provides additional information about _my brother_.)
